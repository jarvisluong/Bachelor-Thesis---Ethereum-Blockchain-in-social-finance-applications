\begin{abstract}

Centralized network solution have been around for a long time, despite having a considerable issue of trust, in which users need to rely on the implementation of the system. During unfortunate incidents such as centralized server hacking attacks, users' data can be stolen and distorted, as well as not available while requested. Blockchain is discovered and believed to be a distributed network solution which can mitigate the above issue.

This bachelor's thesis studies how blockchain network can be integrated into a social financial mobile application. The research is completed by developing a smart contract and connect it with the mobile application. The smart contract is written in the Solidity programming language and run on the Ethereum network.
