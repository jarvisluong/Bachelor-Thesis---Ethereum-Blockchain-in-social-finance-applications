Even though blockchain is a new technology, researches for many industries have been published to prove its benefits towards blockchain, such as health care \citep{DEMARINIS2018400}, supply chains management \citep{doi:10.1080/00207543.2018.1533261}, insurance \citep{Zhou2018}, technology such as the Internet of Things \citep{REYNA2018173} and especially finance industry with banking \citep{Guo2016}. Thus, blockchain has become a compelling topic for new theses. For example, Jutila \emph{et al.} suggested blockchain's advantage for financial services and provided applications in the conceptual level \citep{LauraJutila2017}. However, there was not a specific application implementation for an example financial service. Therefor, this thesis is intended to provide such information: implementing a smart contract for a social financial application, which records the event happened in a social cost split event.
